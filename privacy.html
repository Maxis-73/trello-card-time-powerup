        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties.</strong> All data remains within 
            your Trello account and is only accessible through the Trello Power-Up API.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            The security of your data is managed by Trello's infrastructure and security measures. This Power-Up:
        </p>

            <li>Uses Trello's official Power-Up API for all data operations</li>

            <li>Follows Trello's security best practices for Power-Ups</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. 
            While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

        </ul>
